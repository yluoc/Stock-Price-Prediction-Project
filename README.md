# Stock-Price-Prediction-Project
In this machine learning project, we will develop stock prediction model with neural network to predict the returns on stocks.

Learn how to develop a stock price prediction model and how to build an interactive dashboard for stock analysis. We implemented stock market prediction using the LSTM model, OTOH, Plotly dash python framework for building dashboards.
